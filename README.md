JIRA-Modifications
==================

These are modifications for JIRA that eventually will extend to all of the board pages. Currently the agile board view is the only one that is fully modified, the rest are coming soon. All of this is done using CSS via stylish and JS via a userscript plugin.

This was tested with Stylish and Tampermonkey on Chrome, and Stylish and Greasemonkey on Firefox.
